        If you're reading this, then you are exactly where I was 8 years ago.

      <p>
        You've probably watched hours of tutorials and done many small projects.
        But you still find yourself needing more.

      <p className="font-semibold text-primary">It's not your fault.</p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, there aren't many good resources out there to learn
        React. Most content out there is shallow and doesn't actually teach you
        anything real.
      </p>
      <p>
        To truly learn React, you need more than just tutorials. You need to
        tackle something that has a bigger scope.
