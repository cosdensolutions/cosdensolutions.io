        You might have the desire to build something great, but you don't know
        how.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every guide out there is shallow and never shows you how to build
        something real.
      </p>
      <p>
        The projects they have you build are simple and often forget to handle
        critical pieces.

        This is the reality of learning React today. The odds are stacked
        against you.

        How can you ever hope of becoming a React developer if no one is showing
        you how to do it?
